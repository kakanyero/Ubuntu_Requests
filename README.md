# Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher Assignment
The Wisdom of Ubuntu: "I am because we are"

In the spirit of Ubuntu, which emphasizes community and sharing, your task is to create a program that connects to the global community of the internet, respectfully fetches shared resources, and organizes them for later appreciation.

# Your Task

Create a Python script that:

Prompts the user for a URL containing an image

Creates a directory called "Fetched_Images" if it doesn't exist

Downloads the image from the provided URL

Saves it to the Fetched_Images directory with an appropriate filename

Handles errors gracefully, respecting that not all connections succeed

# Requirements

Use the requests library to fetch the image

Check for HTTP errors and handle them appropriately

Create the directory if it doesn't exist using os.makedirs() with exist_ok=True

Extract the filename from the URL or generate one if not available

Save the image in binary mode

Ubuntu Principles to Implement

Community: Your program should connect to the wider web community

Respect: Handle errors gracefully without crashing

Sharing: Organize the fetched images for later sharing

Practicality: Create a tool that serves a real need

Save Your Work in a GitHub Repo Called "Ubuntu_Requests" and Submit the URL for this Repository to Complete the Assignment.
